# CodeBook

This codebook describes the data and the variables and transformations needed to perform cleanup and eventually converge to a tidy data set.

## Data source

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## UCI Data Set Metadata

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## The data

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Metadata around the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set data.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training label data.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test data.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test label data.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.


## R code Transformations


Consists of 4 parts:

1. First merge the training and test data to create one data set.
2. For each measurement build a feature filter to extract only the standard deviation and the mean for every measurement.
3. Creates activity names for the activities and labels data set with these
4. Creates a second, tidy data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Implementation Details around the r code

* Install as deemed necessary  ```reshape2``` and ```data.table``` libraries.
* Load test and training data and the features and activity labels
* Using the feature filter extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data
* Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.
* Merge data set.
* Combine the id variables and the measured variables
* Save  clean data set to a file
